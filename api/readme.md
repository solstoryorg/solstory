## Structure
The solstory API is a direct subclass of the automatically generated anchor API, which
means you can interact with it in the same way you would any other anchor application.
In addition, the API contains a {@link SolstoryClientAPI |client},
{@link SolstoryServerWriterAPI |server/writer} (a system writing data to solstory
hashlists) and {@link SolstoryServerCreatorAPI |server/creator}
(an NFT creator wishing to add or approve applications implementing
solstory functionality to their NFTs) section to fulfill common workflows and
tasks for each of these parties.

For a better overview of the architecutre as a whole, see the docusaursu.

The convenience libraries (client writer/server writer/creator) natively sign requests
in that respective role with the key that SolstoryAPI/Anchor was initialized with. If
the API was initialized with the useAnchorWallet capability of the solana-wallet-adapter
library, then this will lead to a signature request visible to the user.

If this behavior is unwanted, simply use the exposed anchor methodsâ€“architecture primitives
are enforced on the server side, though it's worth checking out the types and making sure
that any self hosted thirdparty {@link SolstoryItemContainer} fits the spec.

## Usage

When using this clientside, it's highly recommended to use the solana wallet adapter
cra found here: https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/blob/master/packages/starter/create-react-app-starter/config-overrides.js

You'll need to browserify stream anyway for the adapter to work, and for our purposes
you should browserify `crypto` and `buffer`
